SVDQuant is a post-training quantization technique for 4-bit weights and activations that well maintains visual fidelity. On 12B FLUX.1-dev, it achieves 3.6× memory reduction compared to the BF16 model. By eliminating CPU offloading, it offers 8.7× speedup over the 16-bit model when on a 16GB laptop 4090 GPU, 3× faster than the NF4 W4A16 baseline. On PixArt-∑, it demonstrates significantly superior visual quality over other W4A4 or even W4A8 baselines. "E2E" means the end-to-end latency including the text encoder and VAE decoder.

## Method

#### Quantization Method -- SVDQuant

![intuition](./assets/intuition.gif)Overview of SVDQuant. Stage1: Originally, both the activation $\boldsymbol{X}$ and weights $\boldsymbol{W}$ contain outliers, making 4-bit quantization challenging.  Stage 2: We migrate the outliers from activations to weights, resulting in the updated activation $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ and weights $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$. While $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}$ becomes easier to quantize, $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ now becomes more difficult. Stage 3: SVDQuant further decomposes $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}$ into a low-rank component $\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ and a residual $\hat{\boldsymbol{W}}-\boldsymbol{L}_1\boldsymbol{L}_2$ with SVD. Thus, the quantization difficulty is alleviated by the low-rank branch, which runs at 16-bit precision. 

#### Nunchaku Engine Design

![engine](./assets/engine.jpg) (a) Naïvely running low-rank branch with rank 32 will introduce 57% latency overhead due to extra read of 16-bit inputs in *Down Projection* and extra write of 16-bit outputs in *Up Projection*. Nunchaku optimizes this overhead with kernel fusion. (b) *Down Projection* and *Quantize* kernels use the same input, while *Up Projection* and *4-Bit Compute* kernels share the same output. To reduce data movement overhead, we fuse the first two and the latter two kernels together.


## Performance

![efficiency](./assets/efficiency.jpg)SVDQuant reduces the model size of the 12B FLUX.1 by 3.6×. Additionally, Nunchaku, further cuts memory usage of the 16-bit model by 3.5× and delivers 3.0× speedups over the NF4 W4A16 baseline on both the desktop and laptop NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs. Remarkably, on laptop 4090, it achieves in total 10.1× speedup by eliminating CPU offloading.

## Installation

**Note**:

*  For Windows user, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/issues/6) for the instruction.

* We currently support only NVIDIA GPUs with architectures sm_86 (Ampere: RTX 3090, A6000), sm_89 (Ada: RTX 4090), and sm_80 (A100). See [this issue](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku/issues/1) for more details.


1. Install dependencies:
	```shell
	conda create -n nunchaku python=3.11
	conda activate nunchaku
	pip install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
	pip install diffusers ninja wheel transformers accelerate sentencepiece protobuf
	pip install huggingface_hub peft opencv-python einops gradio spaces GPUtil
	```
	
2. Install `nunchaku` package:
    Make sure you have `gcc/g++>=11`. If you don't, you can install it via Conda:
  
	```shell
	conda install -c conda-forge gxx=11 gcc=11
	```
	
	Then build the package from source:
	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/mit-han-lab/nunchaku.git
	cd nunchaku
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	pip install -e .
	```

## Usage Example

In [example.py](example.py), we provide a minimal script for running INT4 FLUX.1-schnell model with Nunchaku.

```python
import torch
from diffusers import FluxPipeline

from nunchaku.models.transformer_flux import NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel

transformer = NunchakuFluxTransformer2dModel.from_pretrained("mit-han-lab/svdq-int4-flux.1-schnell")
pipeline = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell", transformer=transformer, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
).to("cuda")
image = pipeline("A cat holding a sign that says hello world", num_inference_steps=4, guidance_scale=0).images[0]
image.save("example.png")
```

Specifically, `nunchaku` shares the same APIs as [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and can be used in a similar way. The FLUX.1-dev model can be loaded in the same way by replace all `schnell` with `dev`.

## ComfyUI

Please refer to [comfyui/README.md](comfyui/README.md) for the usage in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

## Gradio Demos

### Text-to-Image

```shell
cd app/t2i
python run_gradio.py
```

* The demo also defaults to the FLUX.1-schnell model. To switch to the FLUX.1-dev model, use `-m dev`.
* By default, the Gemma-2B model is loaded as a safety checker. To disable this feature and save GPU memory, use `--no-safety-checker`.
* To further reduce GPU memory usage, you can enable the W4A16 text encoder by specifying `--use-qencoder`.
* By default, only the INT4 DiT is loaded. Use `-p int4 bf16` to add a BF16 DiT for side-by-side comparison, or `-p bf16` to load only the BF16 model.

### Sketch-to-Image

```shell
cd app/i2i
python run_gradio.py
```

* Similarly, the demo loads the Gemma-2B model as a safety checker by default. To disable this feature, use `--no-safety-checker`.
* To further reduce GPU memory usage, you can enable the W4A16 text encoder by specifying `--use-qencoder`.
* By default, we use our INT4 model. Use  `-p bf16` to switch to the BF16 model.
